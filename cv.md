### About myself #

I've worked as a process engineer, shift supervisor, chemical engineer, customer service specialist, and lead purchasing specialist for an online store.  
One day I got into a 10-day HTML/CSS layout marathon. And I realized how fascinatingly and amazing it is to create and layout websites and applications.  
Looking at my previous experience, I realize that I can do anything.  
I can do it and become a Frontend Developer.
